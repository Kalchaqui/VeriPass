## Versión Actualizada para Cronos x402 Paytech Hackathon

---

### **Introducción (30 segundos)**

Hello everyone, I'm going to present **VeriScore**.

VeriScore is a B2B on-chain credit scoring infrastructure that, through a database layer and AI agents, provides verifiable credit scoring to Web3 financial institutions, enabling them to offer collateral-free on-chain credit services similar to traditional banks and credit card companies.

**Built for the Cronos x402 Paytech Hackathon**, VeriScore leverages Cronos EVM, the x402 payment protocol, and Crypto.com AI Agent SDK to deliver a complete credit scoring solution.

### **El Problema (45 segundos)**

The first problem is that exchanges have very little information about the real user. They cannot verify a user's identity the way banks do, and they cannot assess whether a user is able to repay a loan. This is because there is no verifiable credit history in Web3; data is fragmented across platforms, and exchanges cannot audit credit information. There is also no standardized scoring system, which means exchanges cannot make informed lending decisions and face a high risk of default.

Additionally, existing solutions lack integration with AI agents for automated monitoring and don't provide accessible data interfaces for AI assistants to query credit information in real-time.
